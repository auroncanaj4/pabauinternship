# pabauinternship

This project's main purpose is to demonstrate skills in different fields of front-end technologies such as: JavaScript, ReactJs and TypeScript. Being relatively new to some of the concepts of the topics that these tasks covered, there were some difficulties along the way, pointing out to the TypeScript task.

Tasks of this project as a whole are relatively easy to test and look around the job that was done in order to accomplish these results. To have the chance of opening the task that was developed using React, first we need to open reactjs project inside of React folder and install node_modules using npm install command, and then start it using npm run start.
